    <p>Sources are the beginning of all simulations but to talk about them we need to start off by talking about Entities.</p>
    <p>Entities are an abstract representation of the things that move through your simulations. Theyâ€™re an abstract representation because there is no visual representation of entities in Divination. Different simulations will conceptualize entities differently:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A bank could think of entities as customers and loan-seekers</li>
      <li>An airline may write a simulation which thinks of entities as individual planes moving around the world</li>
      <li>A shipyard could think of entities as ships moving in and out of harbor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sources have only one job in your simulations: generate entities.</p>
